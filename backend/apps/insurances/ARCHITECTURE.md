## Implemented API Architecture & Features

This section details the implemented features, turning the conceptual architecture into a tangible, professional-grade API.

### 1. API Endpoints & Structure
The module exposes a comprehensive RESTful API built with Django REST Framework.

-   **Core CRUD Endpoints**: Full Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for all core models:
    -   `/api/insurances/policies/`
    -   `/api/insurances/commissions/`
    -   `/api/insurances/advisers/`
    -   `/api/insurances/clients/`
    -   `/api/insurances/insurers/`
    -   And all `CommissionModifier` types (`/retentions/`, `/clawbacks/`, etc.).
-   **Standard Features**: All list endpoints support **pagination**, **filtering** (e.g., `?status=Active`), and **full-text search**.
-   **Performance**: Implemented `PolicyListSerializer` and `PolicyDetailSerializer` pattern to optimize list views. Database queries are optimized with `select_related` and `prefetch_related` to prevent N+1 problems.

### 2. Security & Permissions
A multi-layered security model ensures data integrity and confidentiality.

-   **Authentication**: All endpoints require Token-based authentication (`Authorization: Token <token>`).
-   **Object-Level Permissions**: Users can only view or edit data they own. An adviser cannot see or modify another adviser's policies or commissions.
-   **Hierarchical Permissions**: The system supports manager-subordinate relationships. A manager can view and manage data (policies, clients, commissions) belonging to their direct subordinates.

### 3. Business Process Automation
The API actively participates in business processes, reducing manual work.

-   **Asynchronous Data Ingestion**: A dedicated endpoint (`/api/insurances/ingestion/ingest-commissions/`) allows for bulk-uploading commission statements.
    -   Processing is handled **asynchronously** using Celery and Redis to prevent request timeouts.
    -   A task tracking system (`/api/insurances/ingestion/{task_id}/`) allows users to monitor the status and see the results of their import tasks.
-   **Automated Clawback Creation**: When a policy is cancelled via the API (`/api/insurances/policies/{id}/cancel/`), the system automatically generates a corresponding `Clawback` record for the associated commission.
-   **Data Integrity**: The API enforces business rules, such as preventing the creation of policies with a start date in the past and automatically assigning the correct adviser upon creation.

### 4. Analytics & Dashboard
The API provides powerful, ready-to-use analytical endpoints.

-   **Reporting Module** (`/api/insurances/reports/`):
    -   `adviser-performance`: KPIs for advisers (policy count, commission totals), respecting the user's position in the hierarchy.
    -   `commission-by-insurer`: Financial breakdown by insurer (Admin only).
    -   `cancellation-analysis`: Statistical analysis of policy cancellations and their reasons (Admin only).
    -   All reports support dynamic **date-range filtering**.
-   **Personal Dashboard** (`/api/insurances/dashboard/`): A single, aggregated endpoint providing an adviser with their key metrics for the current month (new policies, commissions, upcoming renewals) and a list of recent activities.

### 5. Engineering Excellence
The project is built on professional software engineering practices.

-   **Automated Testing**: A comprehensive test suite covers security, business logic, and data aggregation, ensuring system stability and reliability.
-   **API Documentation**: The project includes auto-generated, interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) via `drf-spectacular`, making it easy for frontend developers to understand and use the API.
-   **Admin Panel**: A fully configured Django Admin interface provides a powerful back-office tool for data management and troubleshooting.
-   **Clean Code**: The codebase follows the DRY principle, using mixins and base classes to eliminate code duplication and improve maintainability.
